The scripts in this folder are to get expression levels for TRIP experiments. 

Before doing anything, make sure that the multiplexing barcodes (MPBC_file) contains the correct P1 barcodes. MPBC_file contains a header, and each line is the MPBC name and barcode, tab-separated. 

1. Run illumina_demultiplex.py using the illumina_demultiplex.sbtach script. 
2. Change the number of nodes in the sbatch file for parallelising if needed.
3. Run get_bc2_counts.sbatch using the get_bc2_counts.sbatch script. The lookup files are automatically generated by illumina_demultiplex.py.
